## What is OmniRealms?

OmniRealms is an ambitious gaming framework that enables seamless exploration across different scales of reality - from quantum to galactic levels. Built on cutting-edge Java technology and powered by jMonkeyEngine, OmniRealms isn't just a game - it's a platform for multiple interconnected educational and entertainment experiences.

### The Universe Structure

Our universe is divided into distinct but interconnected realms:

- **Quantum Realm** (10⁻³⁵ to 10⁻¹⁵ meters)  
  Explore quantum mechanics, particle physics, and the fundamental forces of nature

- **Microscopic Realm** (10⁻¹⁵ to 10⁻³ meters)  
  Discover cellular biology, molecular interactions, and microscopic ecosystems

- **Human Realm** (10⁻³ to 10³ meters)  
  Experience everyday physics, human-scale interactions, and traditional gameplay

- **Planetary Realm** (10³ to 10¹³ meters)  
  Navigate planetary systems, geological processes, and atmospheric phenomena

- **Galactic Realm** (10¹³+ meters)  
  Explore stellar evolution, galaxy formation, and cosmic structures

## Games in Development

We're taking a methodical approach to building out the OmniRealms universe. Our first release will be:

### 🎮 MicroQuest: Cell Explorer
A beginner-friendly educational game focusing on cellular biology and microscopic exploration. Players will:
- Navigate through cellular structures
- Solve puzzles based on biological processes
- Learn about cellular biology through hands-on interaction
- Experience smooth transitions between molecular and cellular scales

This initial game will help us validate our core technologies:
- Scale transition system
- Educational framework integration
- Real-time multiplayer capabilities
- Cross-scale physics engine
