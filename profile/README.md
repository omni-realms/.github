# Omni Realms Universe

Welcome to the Omni Realms Universe, an expansive, procedurally generated multiverse where players can explore countless realms across multiple scales of existence—from the cosmic web of galaxy clusters to the microscopic world of cells. This unprecedented gaming ecosystem spans the very fabric of reality, offering a breakthrough in procedural generation technology and an interconnected universe where every action has lasting consequences. Drawing inspiration from omnipresence and infinite possibility, Omni Realms empowers players to transcend traditional gaming boundaries, wielding extraordinary abilities to explore, create, and influence realms from entirely new perspectives.

The Omni Realms Universe is home to a diverse collection of interconnected games, each offering unique gameplay experiences while sharing a cohesive mythology centered around **Realms**—distinct scales of existence—and **Titans**—ancient, godlike entities whose legacy shapes the multiverse. Whether you're crafting voxel worlds, racing across alien tracks, or unraveling cosmic mysteries, every game contributes to a shared narrative and dynamic universe.

## Overview

In the Omni Realms Universe, players embody "vessels"—containers for consciousness that enable exploration across different scales of existence. From stellar vessels roaming the cosmos to microscopic organisms navigating cellular realms, each vessel offers distinct capabilities, limitations, and interactions with its environment. A cosmic vessel might manipulate gravitational fields and solar winds, while a microscopic one interfaces with chemical gradients and cellular processes. Players can upgrade vessels through technological or biological means, merge consciousness with other forms, or create entirely new types via advanced research, introducing fascinating mechanics around evolution and identity.

This repository serves as the central hub for the Omni Realms Universe, housing the specifications, codebases, and documentation for all associated games. Below, you'll find an overview of the universe's structure and a detailed look at each game within this interconnected ecosystem.
